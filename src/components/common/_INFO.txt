Component styles are additive using an array to append extra style rules.

When creating a reusable component, adding [styles.xxx, props.style]
allows you to pass extra styling as a prop to the component


Naming conventions:

Difficult to decide

Within a component, maybe it makes sense to omit the "type" of component in the
name, but perhaps with props, the name should be included to make stylesheets
in parent components easier to use.


Try to make it so all the logic is contained in the class that also keeps track of state?
